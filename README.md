# Claude Architect Journey
I design, build, and deploy AI systems (production tools, automated workflows, and
multi-agent pipelines) using the Claude API. This is the public record of how I got here.

Inspired by [@cyrilXBT's roadmap](https://x.com/cyrilXBT). Tracked with projects,
milestones, and weekly notes.

---

## Who I Am
CPA and problem solver. My background is in consulting for private equity and hedge funds, largely focused on process optimization and controls. I'm relentless about delivering for the people who depend on me. I won't leave a broken process alone.

The last time a technology hit me like this was 1998. Grade school. Our family got a
computer and AOL for the first time. That same feeling (*the world just changed and I need
to understand everything about it*) is exactly what happened when I started building
seriously with Claude. Except now I know enough from my education and day job to build something useful.

---

## Why This Exists
The gap between hobbyists and people earning income from AI is architecture: how to design systems that are reliable, useful, and shippable. This is my public commitment to closing that gap.

**Rules I'm following:**
- Build every single week. No reading-only weeks.
- Ship publicly. Every project gets a README and a demo.
- Use Claude to build with Claude (yes, it's meta).

### PortCo Value Creation Agents

Four agents shipped as one body of work (May 2026): a private-equity portfolio-company
value-creation suite. Each runs a deterministic diagnostic on one operational lever, uses
Claude for the judgment layer, and rolls a single-portco win up to a fund-level EBITDA and
MOIC story. All public on GitHub, all on synthetic data with production-grade logic.

## Weekly Log

### Month 1: Foundation (Early–March 2026)

**Tax Season (Early 2026)**
First high-stakes Claude use: worked through a full personal tax filing using Free Tax USA
with Claude as a co-pilot. Looking up deductions, interpreting edge cases, checking my
logic. Not a "project" in the traditional sense, but the experience that showed me Claude
could handle real professional work with the right guidance, not just demos.

**Week 1 (Mar 9)**
Shipped the first API call: a six-line Node.js script that hit Claude Haiku and got a
response. Confirmed the pipeline worked. Same session: started the Municipal Meeting Scanner.

Built the Business Prompt Library: six production Claude skills: `pch-advisory` (CFO/COO
advisory ops), `regpartner` (SEC private fund compliance), `invcogaap` (ASC 946 accounting),
`sbgc-email` (community email drafting), `website-copy`, and `resume-builder`.

Key lesson: a well-structured system prompt with hard rules and context files is 10x more
useful than a generic prompt. Architecture matters here exactly like it does in code.

---

### Month 2: Master the API (March–April 2026)

**Municipal Meeting Scanner (Mar 9–11)**
Node.js + Playwright visiting ~20 local government websites, pulling agendas and minutes,
sending content to Claude Haiku, and returning housing/zoning items with relevance scores
into a formatted HTML report. First production tool. First lesson in web scraping:
government websites are messy, inconsistent, and slow.

**Workforce Housing Analyzer (Mar → ongoing)**
Leelanau County parcel workbook, now at v102. Each version adds AI-assisted analysis
layers: ownership clustering, parcel size filtering, proximity scoring. First real
experience with Claude as an iterative analytical partner on a live dataset. Also used
Python to extract tax parcel data across Leelanau County, Michigan in minutes versus
$2,500 from the County.

**Kalshi Trading (Apr 2)**
Started as an academic research paper, became a live trading bot on Kalshi (the regulated
prediction market platform). The model is trained to find a signal edge on Bitcoin contracts
and short-dated options. Currently in ML training.

**Obsidian Second Brain (Apr 13 → ongoing)**
Started as Obsidian + Web Clipper for capturing research, articles, and notes, with a
Sunday writing practice. Has since matured into a working synthesis engine: standardized
capture templates, including a new YouTube transcript template, feed Claude-assisted
synthesis on two fronts: synthesized writing and densely linked maps of content.

**Aether Advisors + Monthly Financials Builder (Apr 23)**
Two projects launched the same day. Aether Advisors: building the AI infrastructure for
my wife's marketing company: image generation, marketing program design, brand strategy.
Monthly Financials Builder: Python CLI that takes raw QBO exports and assembles a complete
board financial package with one command. Now used every month for a nonprofit I am Treasurer for.

Key lesson: not every automation needs AI. This one is mostly deterministic, and that's
the right call.

**Email Eval Framework (Apr 2026)**
HTML scoring system for reviewing AI-drafted community emails against non-profit's strict brand
voice and terminology rules. First structured evaluation layer.

---

### Month 3: Tools & Agents (May 2026, current)

**Parish Bookkeeping System (Apr 2026)**
Stepped in as interim bookkeeper for a parish (2 churches, a school, and several
ministries). The previous bookkeeper had 30 years of undocumented institutional knowledge.
Now: documenting every process from scratch, integrating platforms with QuickBooks, moving
paper workflows to digital, writing a proper training manual. Claude handles drafting,
summarizing, and process design.

**Resume Builder Skill (May 2)**
After enough manual resume tailoring sessions, formalized it into a Claude skill. Feed it
a job description, it produces a tailored version of my formatted master resume with
pre-approved language pulled from past versions. Trained iteratively over many uses.

**Fraud Finder (May 2)**
Public-data scraper and relationship-mapping agent: pulling Illinois state contract data,
entity registrations, and political contribution records, then using Claude to find
suspicious connections between newly formed LLCs, contractors, and politicians. First
serious agentic pipeline: search, parse, correlate, flag.

**Claude Audit (May 7)**
Python script to audit and clean up a computer's file system using AI: scans, categorizes,
and surfaces what to keep, archive, or delete.

**Family Flow App (started Mar, bulk of work May 2026): ahead of roadmap**
Concept started in March, shipped the real features in late April/early May:
- Shared calendar aggregation for the whole family
- Grocery store integration: reverse-engineered hidden APIs using Claude Code to pull
  weekly deals and inventory (no documentation; inferred structure from network requests)
- Financial dashboard for household spending
- Plaid integration in progress (connecting spouse's accounts)
- Cash flow predictor on Supabase: model logic in progress

The grocery API work was the hardest piece. Claude Code had to infer endpoint structure
from browser network traffic and iterate until the wrappers held. Different level of work.
Will add additional features based on user feedback (my wife).

**Wacker Advisors OS (Mar 2026 → ongoing): ahead of roadmap**
Full operating system for a one-man outsourced CFO/CCO/COO firm. Every workflow automated
or AI-assisted: onboarding, compliance calendars, deliverable tracking, invoice generation,
engagement letters, quarterly reports. Infrastructure is production-ready.

**Kalshi Trading: The Edge Didn't Hold (May)**
The model finished ML training and moved into live paper simulation: 55 settled trades
over a week against a $1,000 bankroll. The verdict was decisive: a calibration study
across 1,274 settled markets, independently confirmed by the live cohort, showed Kalshi's
BTC daily binary markets are already well-calibrated (Brier 0.0032, skill score 0.98). A
directional strategy has no detectable edge. That negative result is the real finding.
The project is now back where it started, as a research write-up.

**007 Trading Agent (May 16 → ongoing): ahead of roadmap**
A multi-agent equities trading system: a from-scratch clone of the published
"TradingAgents" framework. Roughly ten specialized agents ingest market data, argue
opposite sides of every trade, size the position, and clear it against an independent
risk veto. Roughly twenty hardening sprints in: walk-forward backtesting on the deflated
Sharpe, an ablation harness and pandas baselines, and real Alpaca paper-trading
integration. Next up is a multi-day live paper-trading week starting May 26. The track
record becomes the project's research paper.

**Grok Brain Export (May 2026)**
Exporting and cleaning Grok AI conversation history since 2025 and outputs for structured integration
into the Obsidian second brain. Turning raw AI interaction history into searchable,
linked knowledge.

**Email Rip: Secret CFO (May 2026)**
Email content scraper and Claude analysis pipeline targeting the Secret CFO newsletter
archive. Extracting, categorizing, and synthesizing content for reference and pattern
analysis.

**Working Capital Agent (May 22): ahead of roadmap**
A portfolio-company value-creation demo: an agentic accounts-receivable diagnostic and
collections tool for private-equity portfolios. Deterministic analysis finds where cash is
trapped; Claude writes the board-ready narrative and drafts a tone-matched collection
email for every past-due account; a human approval queue gates every send; a treasury
rollup turns one company's win into a fund-level EBITDA and MOIC lift. All synthetic data,
production-grade logic. Public on GitHub.

**Freight Carrier Optimization Agent (May 22): ahead of roadmap**
The sibling demo, applied to freight. Point it at a manufacturer's twelve-month shipment
history; it re-prices every shipment against live carrier rates (EasyPost, Warp Freight),
decomposes the savings lever by lever, and builds a board-ready EBITDA bridge, then runs
the same play across a whole fund. Deterministic math, one narrow LLM step for the
negotiation scorecard, a Streamlit app and a Jupyter walkthrough off a single codebase.
Public on GitHub.

**Inventory Intelligence Agent (May 2026): ahead of roadmap**
Third in the portfolio value-creation suite. Point it at a distributor's inventory
snapshot and 24 months of demand; it segments the catalog ABC × XYZ, sizes
variability-driven safety stock and EOQ cycle stock, surfaces the dead SKUs and the long
tail trapping working capital, and rolls a single-portco diagnostic up to a fund-wide
pooling play using the classical √N bound. Cross-agent guardrails so it doesn't
double-count what the Freight, Procurement, and Working Capital agents already own.
Public on GitHub.

**Procurement Spend Intelligence Agent (May 2026): ahead of roadmap**
Fourth in the suite, and the one where fund-level leverage matters most. Cleans the
vendor master with rapidfuzz, classifies spend into a 10-category taxonomy, surfaces tail
and maverick spend at the portco level, then builds a unified fund-wide spend cube and
prices cross-portco vendor consolidation against tier-break benchmarks. Output is a
category-by-category negotiation playbook an operating partner can take into a kickoff
meeting the next day. Public on GitHub.

**Twitter Stock Research Pipeline (May 17 → ongoing)**
Turned my X bookmarks into a research system with zero capture-time effort. A scheduled
agent scrapes bookmarks every three days, classifies stock ideas into a dedicated Obsidian
track (flagging what it can't call instead of guessing), and feeds a 500+-ticker tracker
refreshed every weekday morning within an API budget. Interactive Claude sessions do the
judgment work: leaderboard ranking, thesis checks, valuation passes. Key lesson: hidden
constraints (X's DOM virtualization, FMP's real free-tier limits) only surface in
production, never in testing.

**Taste Interview: Voice Profile (May 28, completed June 7, 2026)**
A 100-question interview, conducted by Claude, extracting my personal writing voice into
a reusable profile, based on Ruben Hassid's "I am just a text file," heavily customized:
checkpoint saves every 10 questions, HARD RULE / TENDENCY / PREFERENCE tagging,
draft-on-demand exercises. The interview catches you lying to yourself: under questioning
I reverted to clichés that are on my own banned list, exactly what the profile exists to
pin down. Output: `Voice_Profile_Peter_Hanselmann.md` in the Obsidian vault.

---

### Month 4: Real Products
*Roadmap phase. Agent work started early (see Month 3 above).*

**Forge: AI-Native Fund Accounting ERP (Jun 3 → ongoing)**
The most ambitious build yet: a from-scratch fund administration platform (the category
owned by Allvue, Dynamo, and eFront) with an audit-grade, replayable accounting core and
natural language as the eventual interface. Built with a two-tier Claude workflow: Cowork
sessions as architect/program manager (grounded by my InvCoGAAP skill) producing
versioned phase prompts; Claude Code implementing through explicit gates with hard stop
conditions; adversarial multi-agent review verifying every claim against the code. Eleven
phases largely executed in roughly two days, 150+ tests passing under strict
type-checking. Every hard problem so far has been an accounting judgment or a
process-design question, not a coding question. Code private; this one might be a
product.

**Status sweep (Jun 6)**
A full pass across the open board:
- **Forge (26)**: mid-build; first working demo targeted for June 8.
- **007 Trading Agent (17)**: the live paper run that started May 26 is still going,
  extended past the original five-session plan to build a longer record.
- **Taste Interview (25)**: completed June 7, 2026. All 100 questions, output saved to the
  Obsidian vault. Checkpointing did its job.
- **Twitter Stock Research (24)**: new trend-analysis layer: crossing crowdsourced
  conviction from X against bulge-bracket sell-side research (via Schwab) in the vault's
  Stock Research track.
- **Wacker Advisors OS (16)**: firm repositioned May 28 as an AI-native fractional
  CFO + CCO practice across four client profiles; v2 website shell built June 1.
  Publishing is the gate to first-client outreach.
- **Parish Bookkeeping (11)**: the parish hired a full-time bookkeeper; handoff ran on
  a summary package built from the Claude-drafted documentation.
- **Obsidian Second Brain (07)**: synthesis volume still climbing; the Stock Research
  track is now the vault's fastest-growing area.
- **Grok Brain Export (18)** and **Email Rip: Secret CFO (19)**: both complete; marked ✅ Done.

**Kalshi Trading: Published (Jun 6)**
The negative result became a paper: *"Are Bitcoin Daily Binary Prediction Markets
Efficient? Calibration Evidence from 1,274 Settled Kalshi Contracts and a Live
Out-of-Sample Trading Experiment"*, now on
[SSRN](https://ssrn.com/abstract=6891438). The project that started April 2 as an
academic question, became a live trading bot, and found no edge, closes as a published
research finding. Project 06 marked ✅ Done.

**Status sweep (Jun 23)**
- **Forge (26)**: the demo I targeted for June 8 landed, and the build kept going. Since
  then: a distribution-waterfall engine, statement renderers, and ASC 946 financial
  statements (Statement of Assets & Liabilities, Operations, Schedule of Investments,
  Financial Highlights) generated from the FactSet, plus `verify-reproducibility` proving
  each fund's signed log replays byte-for-byte against its attestation. ~140 tests green.
  Next up is the valuation-judgment wedge. Full write-up on the project page.

**Status sweep (Jun 25)**
- **Forge (26)**: core is published and at rest — `main` equals `origin/main`, CI green,
  and all five fund anchors replay byte-identical. Recent sessions closed backlog cleanly
  rather than opening new ground: LP self-service (own class economics + a quarterly LP
  report), a real web-build gate in CI, toolchain bumps, and a Next.js security patch.
  Next, deferred to its own checkpointed session, is byte-exact seed surgery to fold a
  fund's reapply step into the seed. Strategic frame now explicit: Forge is the
  reproducible layer-1 of a three-layer "company brain," sold to GPs through Wacker, with
  pricing tied to provable correctness.
- **Twitter Stock Research (24)**: added more tickers and began measuring returns by
  sector — watch-list sectors against everything else — to see where the bookmarked crowd
  clusters versus where performance actually is. Expanding the analysis next.
- **SBGC CLT — STORM (27, new)**: tested STORM and Co-STORM over a built corpus to review
  a community group's community-land-trust research. First run underdelivered — I anchored
  the synthesis on a single referenced doc, which narrowed and biased the output away from
  what the multi-perspective method is for. Logged as a useful negative result; rebuild is
  to feed a broader,
