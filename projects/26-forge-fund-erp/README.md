# Forge — AI-Native Fund Accounting ERP

**Status:** 🔄 Active — back off rest; value-creation layer advancing with a further CI-green increment and a larger test suite  
**Started:** June 3, 2026  
**Last updated:** July 3, 2026  
**Code:** Private build — details deliberately high-level here  

## What This Is

> **Forge is an AI-native ERP for funds and their portfolio companies that keeps books so clean and reproducible that audit and compliance cost almost takes care of itself.**

Most emerging managers can't easily prove how they got a number — a mark, a capital
balance, a fee calc — until an auditor or LP asks, and then it's a scramble. Forge fixes
that at the source: every economic event, from a capital call down to a portfolio
company's operating expense, is recorded once on a signed, reproducible ledger, and the
books follow by rule. The result is audit-ready books as a deliverable, and a valuation
you can defend without a fire drill.

This is where fifteen years of fund-accounting and audit domain knowledge meets everything
the previous 25 projects taught me about building with Claude. I've migrated funds onto
the incumbent platforms — Allvue, Dynamo, eFront; this time I'm building the thing.

## How It's Being Built

The build process is the story I can tell publicly. A two-tier Claude workflow:

- **Cowork as architect and program manager.** Sessions where Claude and I resolve design
  questions in structured decision batches, grounded by my custom InvCoGAAP skill (ASC 946
  investment-company GAAP). Output: dated, versioned phase prompts and amendment files
  with an explicit precedence order.
- **Claude Code as the implementation engine.** Each phase prompt is handed off verbatim
  and implemented autonomously through explicit gates with hard stop conditions —
  "if any task would force X, STOP and report." No vibes-based progress.
- **Adversarial multi-agent review.** Independent reviewer agents — one engineering, one
  fund-admin SME — verify every load-bearing claim directly against the code, and an
  arbiter agent ranks the fix list. This review caught the demo overstating itself in
  several places; the fix principle became a rule: *fix what makes the demo a lie, defer
  what's merely incomplete.*
- **Persistent project memory.** A living lessons-learned file where every gotcha and
  every binding decision gets logged, so no session starts from zero.

Twenty-six-plus build phases planned and executed across the run, with
the test suite (now several hundred passing tests, strict type-checking across the codebase) holding the
line throughout. The first working demo landed on schedule in early June; the build has since pushed past the demo into the accounting engines themselves.

## Current Milestone

The demo is real and running: sign in, then an LP-to-portfolio-company drill-in that
computes indirect ownership exposure deterministically from the event log, plus per-fund
browse. Since that first demo, the build has added the engines that make it an accounting
system rather than a graph:

- **Distribution-waterfall engine** — tiered GP/LP economics computed straight from the log.
- **Statement renderers and ASC 946 financial statements** — Statement of Assets &
  Liabilities, Statement of Operations, Schedule of Investments, and Financial Highlights,
  generated from the FactSet.
- **`verify-reproducibility`** — replays every fund's signed, hash-chained log and proves
  the projection-state hash byte-for-byte against the issued attestation, so tampering or
  drift is detectable after the fact.

**At rest and fully published (June 25).** The core is stable, not mid-build: `main`
equals `origin/main`, CI is green on both jobs, and all five fund anchors replay
byte-identical against their attestations. The last several sessions closed a run of small
backlog items cleanly rather than opening new territory:

- **LP self-service (closed Jun 24)** — an LP can see their own class economics plus a
  quarterly LP report. This is the investor-facing surface Wacker would hand a GP's LPs.
- **CI hygiene, web build gate, and a security patch (Jun 25)** — added a real web-app
  build step to CI (the root cause turned out to be a dev-mode flag leaking into the
  build, not the framework bug the backlog had assumed), bumped the toolchain, and applied
  the Next.js security patch that closes a known CVE chain.

The architecture underneath: an event-sourced ERP where each fund's git repo is the source
of truth, Postgres is a rebuildable projection cache, every event is Ed25519-signed and
hash-chained, and `forge verify-reproducibility` checks the attestations — running locally
via Docker Compose.

**The one-way door went through (Jun 26).** The byte-exact seed surgery I'd deferred —
folding a fund's reapply step into the seed so a clean `make demo` natively emits its
canonical 141-event log — shipped cleanly. The standalone reapply path is retired and
**zero event bytes changed** against the prior live log; published, both CI jobs green,
briefly back at rest. The step treated like a one-way door went through without breaking
byte-identity.

**Since then the economic engines filled in (late June).** Per-class LP economics landed and
were attested — each share class's economics provable, replayed byte-identical — followed by
a live multi-class fund, a re-baselining reseed, and MFN "better-of-terms" logic across classes.
Each of these that moved an anchor got the full one-way-door treatment: my explicit go, a
pre-planned reseed session, and triple verification.

**Carried-interest attestation — published and live-verified (Jun 30 / Jul 1).** The last
fund-economics phase for now makes carried interest provable off the attested log rather than
a witness calculation, with the LP-facing display switched to serve the attested rows. It went
through its one-way-door merge with my explicit go and is now published. A fresh, read-only
verification pass then re-earned the "live-verified" badge from a clean rebuild: six
consecutive fresh-process reproducibility runs, all five funds byte-identical to their pinned
anchors, the full suite at **620 passing (0 failed)**, and lint clean — with one honest
environmental caveat (the local Docker engine crashed repeatedly on the monolithic test run, so
the suite was run per-file per the standing Windows protocol; the reproducibility core covers
the stability concern independently).

**Now: the value-creation layer's first increment — published and CI-green.** A separate,
off-surface layer reads off the EBITDA-to-equity bridge already in the ledger — tracking
predicted, thesis-mapped value-creation levers (an ITA-mapped "predicted add-back," paired to
the realized bridge by hash) against what actually materializes, per portfolio company and over
time. It's deliberately *anchor-neutral*: it builds on top of the attested surface without
registering into it, so it ships at additive speed under a lighter review tier — and the pin
gate confirmed it moved no anchor and touched no attested code.

One honest note, in keeping with how this project treats mistakes. The increment was pushed
before its independent pre-publish pass was run, and continuous integration went red for about
thirteen minutes on a type-check error that the branch's own close gate hadn't caught — it ran
the linter but not the type checker. It was fixed forward, verified locally the second time, and
is green now, and the lesson is recorded where it belongs: the close gate must run the type
checker too, and a "clean" self-report is a claim to verify, not to trust. The failure was
exactly the one the skipped pre-publish pass existed to catch — which is the argument for the
gate, made the hard way.

**Back off rest (Jul 3).** Forge came out of "at rest" and picked the value-creation layer
back up: a further increment shipped CI-green, and the test suite grew again from the 620-test
baseline. The layer stays anchor-neutral — additive, off-surface work under the lighter review
tier — so it keeps advancing without touching the attested core. (Specifics tracked in the
private build repo.)

## Key Decisions

**Domain expert in the loop, on the record.** Claude drafts the accounting logic; I
correct it as the CPA — and the corrections get logged, not just applied. The marketplace
scan found no existing Claude skill or tool that does fund accounting at all. That gap is
the opportunity.

**Gates, not momentum.** Big phases get subdivided rather than rushed at the end of a long
context window, and irreversible steps get their own focused, pre-planned sessions.

**Match the ceremony to the blast radius.** Not every change deserves the full one-way-door
apparatus. Work that can move an attested anchor gets heavy review and my explicit go; purely
additive, off-surface work gets a lighter tier and ships faster. The mechanical test — does the
attested surface change, does any anchor move — is what tells an unattended loop exactly where
it must stop and ask for a human. That tiering rule is the safety precondition for automating
the build itself.

**Honesty as a feature.** After the adversarial review, demo claims that the code couldn't
back were treated as bugs of the highest severity.

**The strategic frame.** Forge is the reproducible layer-1 of what I think of as a
three-layer "company brain." The buyer is a GP, reached through Wacker Advisors acting as
an outsourced operational CFO; the thesis is that *reproducible-for-anyone* collapses
audit and compliance cost toward zero, with pricing tied to provable correctness rather
than hours. The end state is real-time continuous reconciliation — the books are never
"closed" because they're always provable.

## Lessons Learned

An AI can write production-grade accounting software in days — if a domain expert designs
the decision process around it. Every hard problem so far has been an accounting judgment
or a process-design question, not a coding question. The two-tier prompt-file workflow
(architect sessions producing versioned prompts, implementation gated behind verification)
is the most repeatable engineering pattern I've found in six months of building.

And: adversarial review is non-negotiable. The system was confidently wrong in ways that
only an agent tasked with *proving the demo dishonest* actually caught.
